# Royalty Split (w/ Mintbase)

In this guide, we are going to go through how to use Mintbase mint an NFT with perpetual Royalties, and see the royalty split will also apply to the rent from NiFTyRent.

## Mint an NFT on mintbase.io

[Mintbase](https://mintbase.io/) is a scalable and decentralized NFT Infrastructure on NEAR protocol. Everyone can mint and sell their own NFTs on it.

Go to [https://testnet.mintbase.io/mint](https://testnet.mintbase.io/mint) (for mainnet: [https://mintbase.io/mint](https://testnet.mintbase.io/mint)), and sign in with your NEAR wallet.&#x20;

Then fill the basic information about your NFT. For example:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Next, fill the Forever Royalties. For example:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

Finally, click the "Mint Me" button and you will get your brand new NFT in your wallet.

## Lend your NFT on NiFTyRent

(You can also refer to the [How to lend](how-to-lend.md) guide.)

Go to [testnet.niftyrent.xyz](https://testnet.niftyrent.xyz) and enter the app. Click "Lend my NFT".

Type in the input box and find the NFT you want to lend. Fill the other lending information like the duration and price. Finally click the submit button.

## Collect the Rent and distribute the Royalties

Once the lease is accepted by the borrower (see more: [How to borrow](how-to-borrow.md)) and expires, you can claim the NFT back together with the rent (see more: [How to collect rents](how-to-collect-rents.md)). At the same time the royalties will be automatically calculated and sent to the accounts you provided above.
