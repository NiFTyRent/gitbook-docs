# Shops

Shops are allowed NFT contract (e.g. a game's nft token, Mintbase store) to list its tokens for renting on NiFTyRent. It is a concept used in Marketplace. Normally, one shop relates to a project (e.g. a game), that enables the renting feature.&#x20;

When a project wants to rent its NFT tokens, the corresponding NFT contract needs to be added first. Once added, a Shop front page will be displayed in the Shops section, like blow (Lucky Mooncake, Nifty RPG).  Users who own tokens from that NFT contract will be able to list lease offers of a token. All tokens' open lease listings will be shown in the corresponding NFT contract's Shop.
