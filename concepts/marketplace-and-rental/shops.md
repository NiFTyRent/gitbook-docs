# Shops

Shops are allowed NFT contracts (e.g. a game's utility token, a DAO's membership token, Mintbase store) to rent their tokens on NiFTyRent. It is a concept used in Marketplace. In exchange for the approval, a Shop frontpage will be created for the approved NFT contract. Normally, one shop relates to one project.&#x20;

When a project wants to enable the rental feature for its NFT tokens, the corresponding NFT contract needs to be registered on NiFTy Rent first. Once registered, a Shop frontpage will be displayed in the Shops section, like blow (Lucky Mooncake, Nifty RPG). Owners of the project's nft tokens will be able to create lease offers of their tokens, and borrowers can rent the NFT by accepting a lease offer. All open lease offers of the tokens will be shown in the corresponding NFT contract's Shop waiting for a borrower.

For a borrower, she can use Shops to browse all token lease offers from the corresponding contract and select the one that is most interesting for her to proceed.
