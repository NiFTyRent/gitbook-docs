# Listing and Lease

Listings are used in Marketplace. A Listing is an open lease offer created by its token owner, that is waiting to be accepted by a borrower.  All Listings for tokens from a specific project(contract) can be found in its corresponding Shop, making it easier for a user to search for the best lease offer.

Leases are used in Rental contract. Once a Listing is accepted by a borrower, a Lease will be formally created by the rental contract to record all informations related to this lease. The corresponding listing will be closed and will be taken down from the shop's front page.
