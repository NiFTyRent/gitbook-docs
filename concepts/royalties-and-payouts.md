# Royalties and Payouts

NiFTyRent supports payouts to multiple receivers which enables features such as flexible royalty to creators, commission to marketplace. This is achieved by using the payout settings of the NFT token. Once payouts is set at token mint, the future rent split will be automatically handled by our smart contract. NiFTyRent supports this feature by implementing the Royalties and Payouts standard in [NEP-199](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/Payout).

Through the payouts feature, users such as NFT creators and marketplaces can benefit from renting activities. Similar to the royalties at an NFT purchase, when an NFT lease went through successfully, the rents will be paid to multiple receivers following the pre-defined splits.&#x20;

The royalty support in NiFTyRent is built-in and zero-configuration. Users don't need to worry about handling the payouts manually, the service contract will automatically split the rents with the agreed receivers. All these are done on-chain and can be verified by the users.
