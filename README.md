# Introduction

NiFTyRent is a decentralised collateral-free rental service for utility NFTs in Web3. The NiFTyRent service implements a smart contract that allows lenders (NFT owners) and borrowers (NFT users) to create an on-chain rental agreement based on pre-defined rental terms (e.g. price, duration, payout accounts). Existing projects can easily integrate the rental feature through NiFTyRent's RPCs.

A rental Marketplace is also provided enable users list lease offers and to select the ones that are interesting for them. A lease can be created in a P2P format, when a listing is accepted on Marketplace. The Royalty feature is supported too, which enables NFT creators to receive agreed payouts in the rental market.

NiFTyRent is built with developers in mind. Our Integration SDK (coming soon) will enable dApps and game developers to add rental feature into their projects.
