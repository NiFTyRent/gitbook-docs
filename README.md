# Introduction

NiFTyRent is a decentralised collateral-free rental service for utility NFTs in Web3. The NiFTyRent service implements a smart contract that allows lenders (NFT owners) and borrowers (NFT users) to create an on-chain rental agreement based on pre-defined rental terms (e.g. price, duration, payout accounts). Existing projects can integrate the rental feature through NiFTyRent's RPCs.

A lease can be created in a P2P format. In the near future, a rental marketplace will also be provided to enable users list rentings and to select the ones that are interesting to them. The Royalty feature is supported too which enables NFT creators to receive agreed payouts in the rental market.

NiFTyRent is built with developers in mind. Our Integration SDK (coming soon) will enable dApps and game developers to add rental feature into their projects.

## What can you do with NiFTyRent?

* **If you are an NFT owner**, you can use our website to create a customised rental contract intuitively. You can then collect rents and start making your hard earned NFT to generate revenue. All these are happening without the worry of losing your NFTs after the lease, due to NiFTyRent's secure contract design.
* **If you are a potential NFT user**, you can use our website to accept a rental contract easily and start enjoying the NFTs feature without a big upfront investment to do a purchase. Very soon, in our rental marketplace, you will also be able to search all renting items and choose the one that is most interesting for you.&#x20;
* **If you are a NFT creator**, you will benefit from our renting activities automatically, thanks to the royalty mechanism supported by our rental contracts.
* **If you are a developer,** you can easily interact with our rental contract from RPC calls. Moreover, our SDK (coming soon) will help you add the long-waited rental feature to your projects.

With the growing adoption of utility NFTs, renting is becoming a widely needed feature for users and projects to benefit from the world of Web3. At NiFTyRent, we are committed to provide the best user experience for NFT renting and help Web3 projects to use NFT rentals to grow their business.&#x20;

Currently, the service is built on NEAR system and support all NFT contracts that implement [NEP-171](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/Core.md) and [NEP-178](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/ApprovalManagement.md). It supports using NEAR token as the rental payment, but very soon users will be able use stable coins to pay rent.&#x20;
