# Collect Rent & Claim Back NFT

The owner of the under leased NFT can claim back her NFT and collect the rent, once the lease has expried. This can be done easily the the My NFT page.  We will demonstrate the process here following the same lease used in [lending](lend-your-nft.md) and [borrowing](borrow-an-nft.md) tutorials.

The owner (ty\_dev.testnet) of the leased nft can see the lease status from her My NFT page. Once the lease has expired, a claim back option will be shown.
