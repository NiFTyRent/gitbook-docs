# Set up a Wallet

NiFTyRent operates on the [NEAR Blockchain](https://near.org/). To interact with the system, one first need to set up a crypto wallet. There are plenty of resources online about this topic. You can do your research and create one.&#x20;

**The following Wallets can be used on NiFTyRent:**

* [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/)

After creating and set up your wallet, you can connect your wallet to NiFTyRent through the Sign In Button. Currently, our dApp is running on NEAR testnet. So, please use a testnet wallet to connect.

You also need some funds to pay the gas fees and rent using the platform. NiFTyRent supports all [NEP-141 FTs](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleToken/Core) as rent payment. For better management of the asset types, we added a selected group of most popular FTs on NEAR.

The following FTs can be used on NiFTyRent's dApp:

* wNEAR
* USDT.e
* USDC

To convert native NEAR token to wrapped NEAR, one easy way to do this is using NEAR wallet's Swap option.
