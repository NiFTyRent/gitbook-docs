# Open a Shop

For NFT tokens to be rentable, its NFT contract needs to be approved and added to NiFTyRent first. For a game project, that normally means the contract you use to mint your game tokens. If you are a Mintbase.io user, that means the mintbase store's contract.

Currently, to better manage the allowed rentable tokens, contract approval is conducted by the NiFTyRent team.  This is a simple process, just get in touch with our team through Twitter [@NiFTyRent](https://twitter.com/NiFTyRent) or Telegram(@NiFTyRent).

Once you NFT contract has been added, all the tokens minted from its contract will be able to be lent and borrowed through NiFTyRent. A Shop front page will also be added, so users will be able to see all lease listings from your contract, add more listings, or take any listing offer.

Below is an example of two existing Shops, who enabled rental feature for their tokens.

Going into a shop, user will be able to see all lease offer listings from that contract and check its offer details. A borrower can easily browse and accept a lease to start renting the token. Just like blow.
