# Lend your NFT

Owners of rentable NFTs tokens can lend their NFTs. To do so, she first needs to create a listing for her nft lease offer. Then wait for the offer to be accepted for a borrower. Here, we will show how to  do this. We will demonstrate by using tokens from a [Mintbase](https://testnet.mintbase.xyz/) store [maproom.mintspace2.testnet](https://testnet.mintbase.xyz/contract/maproom.mintspace2.testnet/nfts/all/0).

Before lending your NFTs, check if your NFT contract has enabled the rental feature using NiFTyRent. This can be done by checking if the Shops page has a matching shop front page for your tokens' contract. In this case, the maproom shop from Mintbase.

After [connecting your wallet](connect-wallet.md), head to [My NFT](https://testnet.niftyrent.xyz/app/nfts) section. Here, you will see all the tokens you own. Find the tokens from maproom, which have been made rentable since a shop has been added. Here ty\_dev.testnet owns 4 nft tokens.

Now, ty\_dev.testnet decides to rent the token Map of Paris. She clicks "Lend" and fills in the required details for the lease offer. Here Royalty is calcuated automatically using the tokens's own setting and rent will be later distributed accordingly. More details on royalty, please refer to [here](../concepts/royalties-and-payouts.md).
